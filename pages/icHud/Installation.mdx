<Steps>
### Start Order

In order for the resource to start correctly and not receive any errors, we must start the resources in the following order

```cfg {3} showLineNumbers filename="server.cfg"
ensure core
...
ensure ichud
```

### Setup Config
 
In order for the script to function properly, you must change the Config.Framework setting to your framework in this case it will be "qb-core". Feel free to make any other necessary changes as well.

```lua {3, 5-13, 15} showLineNumbers filename="config.lua"
Config = {}

Config.Framework = "esx" -- newqb, oldqb, esx, newesx

Config.StatusHud = true  -- If you set it to true, the hud will be activated
Config.CarHud = true     -- If you set it to true, the Car Hud will be activated
Config.Notify = true     -- If you set it to true, notifications will be activated
Config.CarPlayer = true  -- If you set it to true, the Car Player will be activated
Config.MusicPlayer = true  -- If you set it to true, the Music of the Tablet will be show
Config.EngineHud = true  -- If you set it to true, the Engine Hud will be activated
Config.RefreshSpeedoMeterTime = 80 -- Time in ms to refresh the speedometer (50 = 0.05 seconds, 100 = 0.10 seconds) if you want to speedometer to refresh faster decress this value.
Config.SetZoomMinimap = 1 -- Set the minimap zoom (0 = normal, 1 = zoomed in)
Config.DisableMinimapModifications = false -- If you set it to true all changes maded to the map will desappear, this will help if there's another script changing minimap stuff.

Config.HideFullStatus = true -- If you set it to true, all the status hud that are at 100% will be hided,if you set to false the status hud will be showed always

-- Config for the Car Radio System Sound
Config.RefreshTimeSound = 0 -- How much ofter the player position is updated ?
Config.distanceBeforeUpdatingPos = 40 -- how much close player has to be to the sound before starting updating position ?

--[[ 
    OPTIONS: LegacyFuel, oxFuel, cdn-fuel, standalone
    OTHER: set the name of the export function, for example: myFuel
]]
Config.FuelSystem = "standalone" -- Set the name of the export functions used by the fuel

Config.SeatBeltOn = "You have fastened your seat belt"
Config.SeatBeltOff = "You have unbuckled your seatbelt"
Config.notVehicleSeatBelt = "This vehicle does not have a seat belt"
Config.commandSeatBelt = "belt"
Config.cruiseOnText = "You turned on speed limiter"
Config.cruiseOffText = "You turned off speed limiter"
Config.cruiseControlOnText = "You turned on cruise control"
Config.cruiseControlOffText = "You turned off cruise control"
Config.cruiseControlnotinVehicleText = "You are not in any vehicle or you are not the driver"
Config.StreamerModeONMSG = "You have activated streamer mode for music."
Config.StreamerModeOFFMSG = "You have deactivated the streamer mode for music."
Config.SpeedUnit = true -- True is km/h -- False is mp/h
Config.notvehicleCarPlay = "This vehicle does not have carplay"
Config.SetNewWaypoint = "You have set a new waypoint"
Config.AnyVehicle = "You are not in any vehicle"
Config.MoneyNotify = "You have ${x} in your wallet"
Config.BankNotify = "You have ${x} in your bank"



Config.SeatBeltEjectSpeed = 20
Config.SeatBeltEjectAccel = 100.0
Config.TimeOutRequestMax = 10 -- Max seconds if user don't answer the request
Config.SetDistanceAudio = 7.5 -- Distance to hear the audio

------------ KEYS -------------

Config.SeatBeltKey = "X"
Config.IndicatorBothKey = "BACK"
Config.IndicatorRightKey = "RIGHT"
Config.IndicatorLeftKey = "LEFT"
Config.CruiseKey = "M"
Config.CruiseControlKey = "L"
Config.EngineButton = "J"
Config.CarPlayerKey = "Y"

File Location: ```ice_hud\src\ui\js\config\translation.js```

<Callout type="info">
