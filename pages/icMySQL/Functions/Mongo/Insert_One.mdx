# InsertOne

## Definition
Inserts a single document into a collection.

**Returns:** A document containing:
- A boolean `acknowledged` as true if the operation ran with write concern or `false` if write concern was disabled.
- A field `insertedId` with the `_id` value of the inserted document.

## Compatibility
You can use InsertOne() for deployments hosted in the following environments:
- MongoDB Atlas: The fully managed service for MongoDB deployments in the cloud

- MongoDB Enterprise: The subscription-based, self-managed version of MongoDB

- MongoDB Community: The source-available, free-to-use, and self-managed version of MongoDB

## Sintax
The `InsertOne()` method has the following form:
```lua
exports["icmysql"]:MongoInsertOne(
   {
      collection = "<collection>",
      document = <document>,
      options = <options>
   }
)
```
The `InsertOne()` method takes the following parameters:
- `<collection>`: The name of the collection to insert the document into.
- `<document>`: A document to insert into the collection.
- `<options>`: Optional. A document expressing the write concern. Omit to use the default write concern.

## Behaviours
##### **Collection Creation**
If the collection does not exist, then the `InsertOne()` method creates the collection.

##### **`_id` Field**
If the document does not specify an _id field, then mongod will add the _id field and assign a unique ObjectId() for the document before inserting. Most drivers create an ObjectId and insert the _id field, but the mongod will create and populate the _id if the driver or application does not.

If the document contains an _id field, the _id value must be unique within the collection to avoid duplicate key error.

## Examples
##### **Insert a Document without Specifying an _id Field**
In the following example, the document passed to the `InsertOne()` method does not contain the _id field:
```lua
exports["icmysql"]:MongoInsertOne( { collection = "myTable", document = {item = "card", qty = 15 }} );
```
The operation returns the following document:
```json
{
   "acknowledged" : true,
   "insertedId" : ObjectId("56fc40f9d735c28df206d078")
}
```
Because the documents did not include `_id`, `mongod` creates and adds the _id field and assigns it a unique `ObjectId()` value.
The `ObjectId` values are specific to the machine and time when the operation is run. As such, your values may differ from those in the example.

##### **Insert a Document Specifying an `_id` Field**
In the following example, the document passed to the `InsertOne()` method includes the `_id` field. The value of `_id` must be unique within the collection to avoid duplicate key error.
```lua
exports["icmysql"]:MongoInsertOne( { collection = "myTable", document = { _id = 1, item = "card", qty = 15 }} );
```
The operation returns the following:
```json
{ "acknowledged" : true, "insertedId" : 10 }
```
Inserting an duplicate value for any key that is part of a unique index, such as `_id`, throws an exception. The following attempts to insert a document with a `_id` value that already exists:
```lua
exports["icmysql"]:MongoInsertOne( { collection = "myTable", document = { _id = 1, item = "card", qty = 15 }} );
```
Since `_id`: 10 already exists, the following exception is thrown:
```json
WriteError({
   "index" : 0,
   "code" : 11000,
   "errmsg" : "E11000 duplicate key error collection: inventory.products index: _id_ dup key: { : 10.0 }",
   "op" : {
      "_id" : 10,
      "item" : "packing peanuts",
      "qty" : 200
   }
})
```

##### **Increase Write Concern**
Given a three member replica set, the following operation specifies a `w `of `majority`, `wtimeout` of `100`:
```lua
exports["icmysql"]:MongoInsertOne( { collection = "myTable", document = { "item": "envelopes", "qty": 100, type: "Self-Sealing" }, options = { w = "majority", wtimeout = 100 } } );
```
If the acknowledgement takes longer than the wtimeout limit, the following exception is thrown:
```json
WriteConcernError({
   "code" : 64,
   "errmsg" : "waiting for replication timed out",
   "errInfo" : {
     "wtimeout" : true,
     "writeConcern" : {    // Added in MongoDB 4.4
       "w" : "majority",
       "wtimeout" : 100,
       "provenance" : "getLastErrorDefaults"
     }
   }
})
```
