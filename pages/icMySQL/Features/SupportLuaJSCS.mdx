# Lua, JS, C# library support
### Description
We made compatible the ice mysql script compatible with Lua, JS and C# libraries, so you can use the same script in any of these languages.
Obviously, you can call the script exports from any language, but this feature is to make it easier to use and read. 

### Use
#### Lua
fxmanifest.lua
```lua showLineNumbers
server_script '@ice_mysql/library/MySQL.lua'
```
server.lua
```lua showLineNumbers
MySQL.Select()...
```
#### JS
fxmanifest.lua
```lua showLineNumbers
server_script '@ice_mysql/library/MySQL.js'
```
server.js
```js showLineNumbers
MySQL.Select()...
```
#### C#
In the server project you have to add a dependency to the MySQL.net.dll file, path: ```ice_mysql/library/MySQL.net.dll```
```cs showLineNumbers
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using CitizenFX.Core;
using MySQL.Server;
using Newtonsoft.Json;

namespace test_csharp.Server
{
    public class ServerMain : BaseScript
    {
        public MySQL.Server.MySQL mySqlInstance;
        public ServerMain()
        {
            mySqlInstance = new MySQL.Server.MySQL();
        }

        public async Task PruebaSelect()
        {
            var result = await mySqlInstance.AwaitSelect(1, "SELECT name FROM players WHERE id=@id", new Dictionary<string, object> { { "@id", 3 } }, true);
            string json = JsonConvert.SerializeObject(result);

            Debug.WriteLine(json);
        }
    }
}
```

### How it works
We've just maded a dependency for each language, in the case of C# we've made a small lib that make the same as the other language, call the exports of the script and return the result.
