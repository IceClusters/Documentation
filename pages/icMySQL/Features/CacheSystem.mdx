# Cache System
### Description
The cache system if a efficient mode to make only necessary queries to databases, that save the new data in a cache and if the data is already in the cache it will not make a new query to the database. This feature is very useful to make a lot of queries to the database without having to worry about the performance of the server.
Using this feature you will save more than the 50% of the time that you use to make queries to the database. If you have made any change to the database for example making a Update query the cache data will be removed and the next time that you make a query to the database it will be saved in the cache again.
